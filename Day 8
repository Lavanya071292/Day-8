Explain about Use case Testing with example

USE CASE:
    Use case testing is a black-box testing technique that validates a system's functionality by creating test cases based on use cases, 
which describe how a user ("actor") interacts with the system to achieve a specific goal. 
It focuses on end-to-end transactions, covering both the main success scenario and potential extensions, or error conditions, to identify gaps that might be missed in component testing. 

KEY ASPECTS OF USE CASE TESTING

Based on use cases: 
    It uses use case diagrams or documents, which outline user goals and system responses, to derive test cases. 

Focuses on user perspective: 
    It views the system from the user's point of view, ensuring the software behaves as expected in real-world scenarios. 

End-to-end coverage: 
    It tests the entire system transaction by transaction, from start to finish, unlike component testing. 

Verifies functional requirements: 
    It helps ensure that the system's functional requirements are met and that the software works correctly to support the user's objectives. 

Includes positive and negative scenarios: 
    Test cases are developed for both the primary success paths and alternative or error paths (e.g., invalid login credentials). 

Supports various testing levels: 
    The test cases derived from use cases are used for system testing and user acceptance testing (UAT).
